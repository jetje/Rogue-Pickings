# Rogue-Pickings

Hi everybody!

Meet Rogue Pickings, one of the projects I made during my learning @Skillcrush to become a developer. 
The goal of this project was to create a single page website for a fictional client. The design was based on a Photoshop design comp.
My job was to recreate the exact design, but then using HTML and CSS.

Very kind regards! Mariette
